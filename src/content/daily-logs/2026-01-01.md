## What I did today

Continued lesson 1 from the Fundamentals of Neuroscience on edX, this first part is mostly
biochemistry and a little of physics, it's taking more time than I had planned cause I'm
not used to studying with 100% full english material, but it's still being fun and I have two
days until this lesson deadline.
