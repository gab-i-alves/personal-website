Finished lesson 1 from the course one day before deadline :)

- **Concept review**: clarified differences between membrane potential, nernst potential, and resting potential
- **Math practices**: application of nersnt and ghk equations to calculare membrane voltage
- **Scaffolding**: created a structured pre-watch study guide for the next lesson (passive membrane properties)

*Study time: 3 hours*
