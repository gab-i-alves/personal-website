Welcome to my space. This is a growing digital garden that I’m intentionally taking better care of from now on. **Each week, there’s something new here.**

Right now, the main focus is the _daily log_ section, which I use for accountability. Because of that, posts may not be as consistent as I’d like, but I hope you still find something useful along the way. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-alves-97889727b/), [GitHub](https://github.com/gab-i-alves). 

_Note: Content is written in either English or Portuguese, depending on the topic._
